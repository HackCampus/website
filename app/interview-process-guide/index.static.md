# Recommended Screening and Interview Process

## Before the interview

- **Pre-screened candidates** -- We pre-screen all candidates for technical ability and fit based on information you have provided us of your requirements. As well as submitting a CV, candidates have to complete an online technical screening. Candidates are asked to submit code samples of personal projects, and are given an architecture question, and a mock code review question. We also ask candidates to self-assess on a number of programming languages, frameworks, and related technologies. We will only send you profiles of candidate who have passed this initial level of screening, and whose skills align with the requirements you have given us.

- **We recommend at most 1-2 interviews to test culture fit, technical ability and communication skills** -- While we are confident that all candidates have a level of technical competency, it is up to each company to assess whether candidates are a fit for the role, and to test specific skills. We recommend at least one interview with a member of your engineering team to get a deeper understanding of each candidate’s strengths and areas for improvement, and to assess whether a candidate will be a fit for the company culturally. If you feel that an interview does not give you enough insight into a candidate’s abilities, a take-home code test (or an online challenge using a service like HackerRank) following the interview may be useful, though we have found that this is often not necessary.

- **We help candidates to prepare for technical interview topics and general interview skills** -- We let candidates know to prepare for questions about fundamental data structures, algorithms & algorithmic complexity, object oriented programming concepts, and object oriented design questions. However, **if you are planning on testing candidates about additional topics (eg. web development, specific programming languages, frameworks, database/SQL principles etc.), please let us know in advance** so we can help the candidates prepare for these topics.

- **Candidates may not have much (if any!) interview experience** -- One of the biggest benefits of internships for students is the experience they gain in interview skills, especially for technical interviews. Please do keep in mind that some candidates will not have had much interview experience, or may be extremely nervous. If a candidate does not know the answer to a technical question, give them a chance to explain what they would do to find a solution. In some cases, follow-up questions over email can provide a lot of insight, while being much less stressful for the candidate.

## After the interview

- **Providing feedback** -- please provide us with interview feedback as soon as possible following a candidate interview, and let us know how you would like to proceed with that candidate. It is likely that candidates you are interviewing may be interviewing with other companies, so it is important that we are able to inform them of the next stage as soon as possible -- this will enable candidates to make more informed choices and increase the likelihood of you hiring the best fit intern(s) for you.

- **Keep the process moving** -- If you wish to invite the candidate back for a follow up interview or wish them to engage in any other activity as part of your process, please let us know the arrangements for this as soon as possible so we can keep the process moving forward

- **Offers/rejections** -- Once you are satisfied that a candidate is a good fit as an intern hire, please let us know as soon as possible so we can do our bit in ensuring your offer is accepted. Equally, if you decide you do not wish to proceed with a candidate, please inform us so that we are able to communicate this to the candidate.

## Making an offer

- **Recommended Salary** -- Our recommended salary is £400 pw (payable directly to the intern).

- **Accommodation** -- One of the benefits of the HackCampus programme is the central London accommodation provided to students for the duration of their internship. This provides them with the security of knowing that they will not need to try find accommodation themselves, and gives them the opportunity to build strong relationships by being a part of the HackCampus intern family.

- **Fees** -- HackCampus will invoice you the equivalent of £250 pw per intern in April, which will cover accommodation fees and administrative costs.

- **Dates** -- The HackCampus internship is for a 10 week period, commencing on 25th June and running till 1st September (last day of work is 31st August). However, if you wish to keep an intern on for longer and they are available to continue with you, or you wish to offer them a full time role following the internship, that would be amazing and just let us know.

- **Contracts** -- Once an offer has been made, we will ask you to prepare a contract for the student, which both parties will sign. We will ensure this is smoothly managed.

- **On-boarding** -- Before the intern(s) start with you, we will run a ‘How to get the most out of you internship’ workshop for all HackCampus 2018 interns to ensure they fully benefit from the opportunity you are offering them. Once they start with you, we will leave it to you organise the structure of their work and time with you. However, we will be at hand for them and for you to support in any way we can.

## Events during the internship

- **Interns’ and Companies’ Meetup** -- the plan is to get everyone together early into the internship, for an informal meetup to get to know the HackCampus community -- this will take place in mid-late June, date TBC.

- **Demo Day** -- the Demo Day will bring together the HackCampus 2018 companies and interns, and HackCampus alumni and others, to provide an opportunity for the interns to demonstrate some of the cool stuff they’ve been working on during their internship. This will take place in late August/early September (exact date TBC).

**Let us know if you have any questions. We are excited to have you partner with us for HackCampus 2018!**
